\section{Brief biography}
My name is Sahand and I'm named after a stratovolcano! I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran in an autumnal september 26th morning, 2004. My first years of childhood were like that of other people, but note that I was interested in astronomy and computers.\\
As a child, I used to spend a lot of time reading books and working with my PC to figure out how things worked.\\
Then I went to school and passed an entrance exam for Sampad schools (A type of school for intelligent students). After that, I showed interest in Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad and became rather successful in it!\\
These days I'm a computer engineering student at Sharif University of Technology.\\
I'm also so interested in learning new things and teaching things I know to people, so I'm currently a teacher (Olympiad instructor more specifically).\\
Beside all of the things I mentioned above, I like playing the guitar and listening to Metal/Rock music as well as reading books.
